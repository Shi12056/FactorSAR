High-Dimensional Spatial Autoregression with Latent Factors by Diversified Projections
================


This repository contains the code for replication of the results in the paper "High-Dimensional Spatial Autoregression with Latent Factors by Diversified Projections".

## Overview
The following code files can be used to reproduce simulation results and the real data analysis presented in the main paper.

1.  A `README.md` file - This file gives a short description of the paper and an overview of how to carry out the analyses presented in our manuscript.
   
2.  A `manuscript` directory - This directory contains the source files (LaTeX) for the manuscript and any files directly related to the eneration of the manuscript, including figure files.
   
3.  A `simulation` directory - This directory contains the files for replication of the simulation results, including code, the simulated data, and the results. See `simulation/README.md` for more details.
   
4.  A `realdata` directory - This directory contains real data analysis files, including code, the real data, and the results. See `realdata/README.md` for more details.
