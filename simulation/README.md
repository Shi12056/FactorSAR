Simulation studies
================

This directory contains all the scripts and outputs used for the simulation studies in the paper. It consists of two subdirectories:

- **`scripts/`**: All code files used in the simulation experiments.
- **`results/`**: Contains simulation data and estimation results generated during the experiments.

## Structure

### 1. Consistency of CMLE Results

The following Jupyter notebooks in `scripts/` correspond to the numerical results on consistency of CMLE in the paper:
